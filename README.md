# IFT6759_Distribution_shifts_WILDS
 Our IFT6759 course work project is based on the paper [WILDS: A Benchmark of in-the-Wild Distribution Shifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07421). We have reproduced results based on existing code and ran experiments with data augment techniques such as Strong, Weak, Cutout and Cutmix techniques along with using Resnet and Densenet model architectures.
 * The code in this repo is based on the following repo: [wilds](https://github.com/p-lambda/wilds)

 * To replicate the results, we suggest running the code on COLAB in the same way as in Run_Experiments.ipynb.
 * Phase 1 and Phase 2 results are stored in [Results](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fm8zeCJ55rNdDw4QKB5tXgExpsFx1ddK?usp=sharing) and Refer to plan.xlsx for the exact commands used for running experiments.
 * Refer to Data_augument.ipynb to see how the augment techniques works on a sample image.
 * Refer to Results_interpretation folder to see some Interesting observations during our learning phase.
